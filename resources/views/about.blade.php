    <p>This is a project for the Fall 2018 Dynamic Web Applications class at Harvard Extension. It's intended to demostrate a contact record management system, where users can add, query, edit, and remove contacts. The site is inspired by  the online software products of the company the developer works at, and is meant to provide the developer with a very basic understanding of how such products might function.</p>
